This gem has been assembled using various different commits from different forks.
The goal has been to collect maximum functionality, while maintaining support for both Rails 2 and 3 and Ruby 1.8.x and 1.9.x.
This gem has not undergone testing yet. Please feel free to test it out, improve it, fix it etc.           

Note: There is also a Mongo Mapper version of acts_as_list out there. 
This is one reason why this gem is postfixed with '_ar' and the module name is ActsAsListAR. 
I hope there will be ports to other storage systems in the future!

Tests:

When I run the acts_as_list_test I currently get a few errors for 'insert' and 'insert_at'. The position of a created item is 5, 6 and so on when it should have been 
1, 2, ...

I'm not sure if this is intended or not, i.e if the tests are to be changed or the code. Feel free to respond to this! 
I will try to contact some of the fork members about this issue.
